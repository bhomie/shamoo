    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Oh Hai! I'm Brian Designer & Maker</h2>
    <p>
      I’m relentless. I do the hard work. I care about forging experiences that better people’s lives. I believe the best work comes from the interplay of evidence, experience, motion, and collaboration. Time to time you can find me bringing my designs to life in code.
      <br />
      I enjoy video games, you can catch me streaming them sometimes on Twitch! I also stream other things like illustration, UX, motion graphics, and 3D Modelling. I’ve taken a huge liking to environment design and have started to create my own worlds in Cinema4d. Other than that you can find me reading a book (I just finished Ready Player One.) Oh and I love sci-fi flicks, only second to my collection of kicks.
